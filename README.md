# Network-Application-Security-Testing

# 🔐 Network & Application Security Testing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Network and Application Security Testing** concepts, where common security weaknesses are identified and analyzed using standard security testing methodologies.

The project is **learning and simulation-based**, created to understand how security testing is performed in real-world environments without attacking any live or production systems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand fundamentals of network security testing
- Learn application security testing concepts
- Identify common vulnerabilities in networks and web applications
- Gain security testing knowledge for internships and interviews

---

## 🛠️ Security Domains Covered
- Network Security Testing
- Web/Application Security Testing
- Vulnerability Assessment basics
- Security best practices and mitigation concepts

---

## 🌐 Network Security Testing
